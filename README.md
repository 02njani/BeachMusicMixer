# BeachMusicMixer

I created this with a team of three. All of the assets and music are composed and drawn by us. This is a music mixer that is controlled by user movement. Each object (except for crabs and turtles) has a different sound. The more you collect of one object, the louder that sound gets. You can check your inventory by pressing Y. Create neat combinations of instruments by collecting specific objects. The crabs are obstacles. If you run into them, you will lose all of your items. The turtles are also obstacles. If you run into them, you will be slow for 5 seconds. If you go into the ocean, you will hear a low pass filter and reverb applied to the sounds. There is also spatialization, so the farther away you go from the ocean, the quieter it will be. The crabs and turtles also have spatialization, so getting closer to them will make the effects sound louder.
